# Bunny

🐇 **Bunny** is a static site generator written in [Harelang](https://harelang.org).

## Inspiration

The inspiration around the project is from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev)'s static site generator in Python. I build this project
out of curiosity of the Hare programming language. I already made a project in Hare but I miss the language
so here we are.

## Features 🚧

# Dependencies

- a c compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.
- a harelang installation. Hare is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hare). If you use openSUSE, just run `sudo zypper in hare`.

# How To Use 🚧
